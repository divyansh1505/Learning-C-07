As part of the Vision Gran Turismo, the world's auto makers developed a concept car for the fans of the video game "Gran Turismo". The car that crowns the opening of this innovative collaboration is the Mercedes-Benz AMG Vision Gran Turismo. The design team of Mercedes-Benz incorporated the image of a large cat on the hunt in the design. And its shape is reminiscent of the legendary 300 SL racing car. With an aluminium spaceframe body and carbon fibre components, the Mercedes-Benz AMG Vision Gran Turismo weighs just 3053lbs. The light weight, paired with the AMG V8 biturbo engine, delivers an exceptionally agile response and lightning performance with 800Nm of torque and 585hp. Composed by sound specialists at AMG, the exhaust note and engine roars of the Vision GT are perfectly tuned to awaken excitement wherever you are.
